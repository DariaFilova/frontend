        <p>
          The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant
          gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the
          ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of the
          head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like"
          appearance.

          The Birman, also called the "Sacred Cat of Burma", is a domestic cat
          breed. The Birman is a long-haired, colour-pointed cat distinguished
          by a silky coat, deep blue eyes, and contrasting white "gloves" on
          each paw.

        <p>
          The Munchkin, also known as Sausage Cat is a breed of cat
          characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by genetic
          mutation. Compared to many other cat breeds, it is a relatively new
          breed, documented since 1940s and officially recognized in 1991.
